## 📌 Project Overview

What makes life “good”? Is it safety, clean air, affordable living, or access to healthcare?

This project explores global **quality of life indicators** using a dataset that combines metrics such as **safety, pollution, purchasing power, cost of living, and healthcare** across countries worldwide. Instead of focusing on a single metric, the goal was to uncover how these factors interact and what they reveal about living conditions around the world.

The project emphasizes **visual storytelling**, using multiple visualization types to make complex global data more interpretable and human-centered.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the `quality_of_life.csv` dataset, which aggregates quality-of-life indicators for countries worldwide, including:

- Safety scores  
- Pollution levels  
- Purchasing power  
- Cost of living  
- Healthcare quality  

This dataset was chosen for its breadth and relevance to real-world social and economic conditions.

## Visualizations Included

The report contains **seven distinct visualizations**, each highlighting a different aspect of quality of life:

- **Bar chart** of the top 10 safest countries  
- **Box plots** comparing health care, safety, and pollution  
- **Quasirandom scatter plot** showing purchasing power distribution  
- **Donut chart** categorizing global pollution levels  
- **Heatmap with hierarchical clustering** revealing relationships between indicators  
- **Lollipop chart** comparing cost of living across countries  
- **Choropleth world map** visualizing global quality-of-life categories  

Together, these visuals provide both **analytical insight** and **intuitive understanding** of global living standards.

## Key Insights

- Countries with higher safety scores often show **better healthcare outcomes** and **lower pollution**
- Purchasing power is concentrated in nations with strong financial systems
- Many countries fall into “Moderate” or “High” pollution categories, raising sustainability concerns
- Higher quality of life is not determined by a single factor, but by the **interaction of multiple indicators**
